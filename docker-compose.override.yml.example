# docker-compose.override.yml.example
#
# Optional Docker Compose override for platform-specific configurations
# 
# For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) users:
# The main docker-compose.yml now uses multi-arch images that work on both AMD64 and ARM64.
# This file is provided as a reference if you need to explicitly set platforms.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file: cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
#   2. Docker Compose will automatically use the override file
#   3. Uncomment and modify as needed for your environment
#
# Note: With the current configuration using eclipse-temurin:17-jre (non-alpine),
# explicit platform specifications are typically not needed.

# version: '3.8'

# services:
#   # Example: Force ARM64 platform for Apple Silicon
#   # Uncomment only if you encounter platform issues
#   
#   # user-service:
#   #   platform: linux/arm64
